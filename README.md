In the dungeon you will face powerful enemies that try to destroy the player. Depending on your god it can give you a boost for your player. Ares god of war gives you a state boost for more enemies you kill in a row it can increase your damage for a short time. Zeus, god of lighting, gives you a unique spell of lightning bolt to throw at your enemies for an AOE. Hades the god of the underworld for 100 gold it can summon undead enemies to fight for you. Hephaestus the god of smithing will allow you to summon a hammer of forge fire to use to burn your enemies.
